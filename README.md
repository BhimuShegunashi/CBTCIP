Iris Flower Data Analysis and Spam Email Detection Projects

This repository contains two projects focused on data analysis and machine learning:

Iris Flower Data Analysis
Spam Email Detection

Iris Flower Data Analysis
This project explores the famous Iris Flower dataset to perform data analysis tasks. The dataset contains four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) of three different species of iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, and virginica).

Files:
Iris Dataset Analysis - Classification.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data exploration, visualization, and analysis.
Iris Flower - Iris.csv: Dataset used for analysis.
Spam Email Detection
This project focuses on detecting spam emails using machine learning algorithms. The dataset consists of email messages labeled as spam or non-spam.

Files:
Email_spam_Detection.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for preprocessing the text data, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
Spam Email Detection - spam.csv: Dataset containing email messages and their corresponding labels (spam or non-spam).
Requirements:
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, nltk
